## Wireframes

Wireframes are generally true to the webpage.  The initial frame had seperate page for each package, however
these were merged into one page upon review.  Full frames (desktop, tablet, phone) can be located at:

## Features

The website uses Bootstrap 4.5.0 due to its layout and responsiveness.  Custom alterations are made
in order to increase customisation of website e.g, color schemes and spacing. 

The following features are also included throughout the page (external sources attributed).

* **Navbar (Bootstrap 4.5.0, Font Awesome and Google Fonts)**
Navbar includes company name styled with 2 different fonts for impact and to emphasise appeal to children.  Bootstrap 4 was used
to set layout. Navbar links hover red.

* **Content (Font Awesome and Bootstrap 4.5.0)**
Font Awesome icons are used throughout the page.  Various icons are coloured/re-sized using CSS.
Page layout used Bootstraps' carousel example page, with custom alteration made to suit client needs.

* **Background images via CSS**
Images are styled using CSS and written as background images.  As images are non-essential
and do not contain any information, this is why this was done as opposed to using a HTML tag.

* **Footer (Bootstrap 4.5.0 and Font Awesome)**
Footer includes contact page link and repeats menu options from Navbar for UX ease.  
Home button is stylised through Font Awesome.

* **Contact Form (EmailJS)**
Using the EmailJS API, customer email template is setup.

* **Links to social media pages (currently to general social media sites).**

* **Google Maps API**
The Map element was created using the Google Maps API and Places library.  Destination co-ordinates were taken from a google map search.

* **Current Weather (OpenWeather API)**
The current weather element was created using the OpenWeather API.  This is updated approximately every 3 hours due to restrictions in current API subscription.

* **Quiz (Javascript and Jquery)**
The Quiz uses Javascript and Jquery.  It was designed with support from Codeexplained.org who demonstrate making a Javascript quiz on their youtube page.  However, as
this quiz is more of a survey, the logic and code had to be different in order to meet client and user needs.  Code was informed by Code Institute lessons and Code Academy activities.


* **Image controls such as toggle, or hide/show (Jquery)**
Images are controlled using JQuery click events.

* **Carousel (Bootstrap 4.5.0)**
Carousel is a Boostrap 4.5.0 template.


## Features Left to Implement
Once up and running, website can implement a booking system for customers.  A live 
chat feature to help a user decide or ask questions is also considered a key piece of UX to add.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4.5.0
4. Font Awesome
5. Google fonts
6. OpenWeather API
7. GitHub and GitPod
8. Jquery
9. Javascript
10. Google MAP API
11. EmailJS API

## Testing

Testing was done frequently throughout the design process. This included continual tests when writing code through the below methods, as well as user feedback on specific
functions/technologies and external validators.  

The website was tested using the following:

## Internal Testing 

**GitHub live preview port**
This was used through `python3 -m http.server` provided by Code Institute. 

**Google Developer Tools**
This was used to view the responsiveness of the webpage through the following:
Pixel 2, Pixel XL, iphone 5, SE, 6/7/8 and plus versions, X and ipad and ipad pro.  

## Errors
The following 3 errors occur during testing and running of the page through the Google Developer Tool.

* **Uncaught Type Error:**  Cannot set property of 'innerHTML' to null.  
This is realted to the quiz answer box's.  Code reads as null if responses did not meet score criteria.  This showed no effect on 
UI or UX with the quiz, which works as required, through the required if statements.

* **GET OpenWeather API Forbidden:** This will occur if page is refereshed within the 3 hour limit set out in API restriction.  As it does not effect
page it is also ignored.

* **LoadMap is not a function (Google MAP API):** Occasionally, Google Maps does not load correctly onto the page.  This has only occured when testing through
the gitpod browser function and has not occurred when tested using uploaded pages on a range of devices.  During user testing, this was not a reported problem
however worth noting and keeping watch over.

## Warnings
The following warnings came on each page:

Cookie associated with cross site resource set without same site attribute.  This had no adverse affect on the page.  Please refer to 
https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592 for more details.

* Developer Tools Emulator
The Google Developer Tools Emulator was also used across mobile and tablet devices with no bugs or unexpected discrepencies between devices.

## External Testing

The website was checked through the following Validation service tools:

### W3 validator (for HTML)

* https://validator.w3.org/

When using the HTML w3 validator, 0 errors and  1 warning about using section headings described below.
- Type attribute not needed for Javascript 

### CSS Validator (for CSS)

* https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator 

No errors.

### JSLint (for Javascript)

1 error found relating to popover function, expecting identifier but finding )};.  Function is taken from Bootstrap 4.4.1 popover element and as 
it works as expected, was noted, but ignored.

### JSHint (for Javascript)

9 warnings were flagged up through this service, based on use of 'let' to declare variables and arrow function syntax.  However, when set for Jquery and new 
ES6 features, they are not flagged.  

### Esprima (for Javascrupt)

Code result was deemed syntaxically valid.

### BrowserStack (for Responsiveness)

* Browserstack was also used to test on the following devices (chosen based on Browserstack Start Up data):

https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-the-right-mobile-devices

https://www.browserstack.com

1. iphone 8
2. iphone XR
3. Google Pixel 3
4. Samsung Galaxy S9+
5. Samsung Galaxy S8 

All tests showed the website as it intended to look with little/to no variation between devices.
Overall the website was consistently responsive according to the above tests  and adhered to HTML and CSS standards set out by validation tools described above.  


## User Testing

A range of random users were contacted to test the page.  Users were selected based on their perceived proficiency with technology to ensure a range of different 
users.  This included testing on devices (as reported by users):

* ipad pro 9.7inch
* iphone 10, 8 and 7
* Samsung Galaxy 9
* Imac desktop
* Windows based Desktop (computer make was not specified)

Testing across devices no discrepencies were found amongst and all features worked.
Users reported that they found the site to be 'professional', 'easy to use' and contained 'a range of options to book from.'

Website was also submitted for Peer Review on Code Institute Slack channel.  Response included suggestions on missing links, which have been rectified.

## Speed

* https://tools.pingdom.com/

Website was tested and given a 'B' with Current Score of 82.

One feature to add in future releases could be the suggested 'Compress components with gzip' as suggested by the speed testing report in order
to further increase speed.  This was the lone item that received a 'C' rating with all others receiving 'B' or 'A.'

## User bugs

No user bugs reported.  
 
## Deployment

### Repository
All code was written on Github using a newly created repository.

https://github.com/samc85/Milestone2-project

### Gitpod Deployment

Code was tested through the GitPod platform by entering 'python3 -m http.server' into the console or by clicking
the windown icon in the right hand corner for a in-window view of page code representation.

### Updates

Using GitHub, HTML, CSS and additional resources were updated via the below process:

* Git add (ed)
* Git commit (ed) -m
* Git push (ed) to Repository

### Published Page

Within the repository, under the settings button GitHub Pages was accessed and published to created
a live website.  This was done through the following steps:

* Access Settings on Repository page
* Scroll down to GitHub Pages container
* Select Master Branch as source
* Publish Page and test live address

Published page is accessible at:
